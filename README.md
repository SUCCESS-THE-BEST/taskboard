## Accessibility and Semantic Decisions for Section 2 Semantic TaskBoard Prototype

1. I used semantic elements like <header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, and <footer> as instructed to structure pages so that screen readers and search engines can understand the page layout easily.

2. I used <label> with the `for` attribute for all form inputs and marked essential fields as `required` to improve accessibility and ensure users input text in the required fields.
